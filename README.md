# Practice-Challenge-2

# Challenge-1
Write an  function to return the most frequently occurring character in a given string.If there is more than one most frequently occuring character return the characters in an array.
For eg. 
```
"test" =>[t]

"string"=>[s,t,r,i,n,g]

"giraffe"=>[f]

"aeroplane"=>[a,e]
```

# Challenge-2
Write a function that accepts two strings and checks whether the first string is an anagram of the second string. If yes, the function returns true , else it returns false.
The case(upper/lower)of the character does not matter. 

For eg.
```
 "Silent","Listen"=>true
 
 "Brag","Grab"=>true
  
 "Stressed", "Desserts" =>true
  
 "Camel","Car"=>false
 ```
