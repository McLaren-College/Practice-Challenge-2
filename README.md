# Practice-Challenge-2

Write a function that accepts a string and returns an Object with two properties(the most frequent character, and its count) . If there is more than one most frequent character the Object value should be an array 

For eg. 

```
"test" =>{
          char:['t'],
          count:2
          }
```
```
"string"=>{
           char:['s','t','r','i','n','g'],
           count:1
           }
```
```
"giraffe"=>{
            char:['f'],
            count:2
            }
  ```
  ```
"aeroplane"=>{
              char:['a','e'],
              count:2
              }
```
